            <p>For those more comfortable designing on a 24-column grid, an alternative version is also included. It
                consists of columns 30 pixels wide, with 10 pixel gutters, and a 5 pixel buffer on each side of the
                container. This keeps text from touching browser chrome â€” helpful for devices like the iPhone, where
                a lower-case "i" or "l" might be easily missed. <a href="#">View demo.</a></p>

            <h2>Source Order
            </h2>
            <p>By utilizing the push_XX and pull_XX classes, elements can be rearranged, independent of the order in
                which they appear in the markup. This allows you to keep more pertinent info higher in the HTML,
                without sacrificing precision in your page layout. For instance, view the source code of this page
                to see how the H1 tag has been re-positioned.</p>
