            <h2>Essence</h2>
            <p>The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used
                dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be
                used separately or in tandem. <a href="index.html"> Read more.</a></p>

        <div>
            <h2>Dimensions</h2>
            <p>The 12-column grid is divided into portions that are 60 pixels wide. The 16-column grid consists of
                40 pixel increments. Each column has 10 pixels of margin on the left and right, which create 20
                pixel wide gutters between columns <a href="flex.html">View Demo.</a>

            <h2>Purpose</h2>
            <p>The premise of the system is ideally suited to rapid prototyping, but it would work equally well when
                integrated into a production environment. There are printable sketch sheets, design layouts, and a
                CSS file that have identical measurements.
